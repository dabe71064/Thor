/**
 * A class providing APIs to an interactive Unix shell.
 *
 *
 * Similar to threads where there is a special "main thread", `libsu` also has the
 * concept of the "main shell". For each process, there is a single globally shared
 * "main shell" that is constructed on-demand and cached.
 *
 *
 * To obtain/create the main shell, use the static `Shell.getShell(...)` methods.
 * Developers can use these high level APIs to access the main shell:
 *
 *  * [.cmd]
